  contact_rate: 'Calibrated within plausible range'
  infectious_period: 'Multiple studies have found a shorter serial interval or generation time for Omicron compared to previous variants \cite{anderheiden2022, delaguilamejia2022, ito2022, xin2023}, with values of five to seven days or less implying short latent and infectious periods. Taking duration of culturable virus as the best proxy for the infectious period, a systematic review and meta-analysis focused on the Omicron variant and reported the time from symptom onset or first positive PCR result to the day after the last positive viral culture to be 5.16 days \(95\% CI: 4.18-6.14\) \cite{wu2023}. We take this as an upper limit of the effective infectious duration because this quantity may be modified as symptomatic persons modify their behaviour to reduce contacts whilst infectious \cite{xin2023}.'
  latent_period: 'The shorter serial interval for Omicron compared to previous variants would also be consistent with a shorter latent period \cite{anderheiden2022, delaguilamejia2022, ito2022}. Transmission pairs were identified through contact tracing from an outbreak of BA.1.1 in Hangzhou (China) in early 2022, through which the latent period was estimated at 3.1 days \(95\% CI: 2.8-3.5\) \cite{xin2023}. The analysis used censoring to account for uncertainty in the time of infection and infectiousness onset from their data on time of contact with the assumed index case and the time of first positive PCR result.'

  natural_immunity_period: 'Although early reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 occurs,\cite{nguyen2022} estimating the duration of natural immunity following infection with SARS-CoV-2 is challenging because reinfection due to the development of immune-escape properties in circulating viruses occurs contemporaneously with waning of immunity. An analysis of non-SARS-CoV-2 human coronaviruses that fitted a transmission model to positive laboratory test results estimated that immunity against infection waned over 45 weeks.\cite{kissler2020} Another analysis of non-SARS-CoV-2 human coronaviruses used antibody dynamics to conclude that reinfection typically occurred 12 months or more following past infection.\cite{edridge2020} However, an analysis of antibody dynamics for a range of human-infecting coronaviruses found that the duration of protection following SARS-CoV-2 infection was less than half of that of several other human-infecting coronaviruses, with reinfections likely occurring from as early as three months post-infection.\cite{townsend2021}Early reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is known to occur,\cite{nguyen2022} and antibodies against the virus decline significantly in the months following infection.\cite{denhartog2021,crawford2021} However, estimating the duration of natural immunity following infection with SARS-CoV-2 is challenging because reinfection due to the development of immune-escape properties in circulating viruses occurs contemporaneously with waning of immunity.

  ba2_rel_ifr: 'Two national-level studies estimated the severity of BA.2 relative to BA.1 using the time period of the epidemic combined with PCR S-gene target failure status to identify cases of each sub-variant. In the United Kingdom, the hazard ratio for death was estimated at 0.80 (95\%CI 0.71-0.90) for BA.2 compared to BA.1.\cite{webster2022} Although a large South African study did not estimate the relative risk of death, the adjusted odds ratio for a composite severe disease outcome was comparable to this estimate (0.78, 95\%CI 0.63-0.97) \cite{wolter2022}. A nationwide study from Denmark \cite{hansen2023} leveraged high coverage with PCR testing and whole-genome sequencing to estimate the odds of hospitalisation with BA.5 relative to BA.2, estimating an adjusted odds ratio of 1.69 (95\%CI 1.22-2.33). An analysis from Scotland was consistent with a comparably increased adjusted hazard of hospitalisation (1.21, 95\%CI 1.03, 1.43) and death (1.55, 95\%CI 0.78-3.08), although with a broad uncertainty ranges.\cite{robertson2023} Although these estimates comparing BA.5 to BA.2 may suggest a greater difference in severity than between BA.1 and BA.2, the South African analysis found no difference in severity between BA.1 and BA.5.\cite{wolter2022}'
