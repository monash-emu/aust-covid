evidence:
  contact_rate: "Calibrated within plausible range"
  infectious_period: "This quantity is difficult to estimate, given that identified cases are typically quarantined. Studies in settings of high case ascertainment and an effective public health response have suggested a duration of greater than 5.5 days \\cite{bi2020}. PCR positivity, which may continue for up to two to three weeks from the point of symptom onset \\cite{he2020} \\cite{byrne2020} does not necessarily indicate infectiousness. The duration infectious for asymptomatic persons has also been estimated at 6.5 to 9.5 days \\cite{byrne2020}."
